To measure the social relations between students, we use a combination of experimental game theory and social network analysis.

We designed a computational non anonymous dictator game that captures social interactions in an ecologically valid context.

An then, we constructed two interaction networks for each classroom in which students are nodes, and links are defined by their behavior in the game.
