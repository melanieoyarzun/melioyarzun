 # Poster: **“Friendship Modulates Hierarchical Relations in Public Elementary Schools”**
 
 Hierarchical relationships are pivotal for social structures in human beings. Yet, little is known about mechanisms connecting social hierarchies and friendship in elementary school children. Here, we present the results of a large-scale experiment (856 children between 9 to 12 years) from 14 different elementary schools in Santiago de Chile, designed to measure social status through aggregated cooperative patterns and then explore the connection between friendship and dyadic cooperation in students with different social status. We map each classroom's cooperative network using a modified Prisoner's Dilemma in a lab in the field setting. In a networked set up of tablet computers, each student played the game in pairs with each classmate. They had to decide simultaneously how many tokens (between o to 10) send to their peers in each round. Thus, we proxy social status using the page rank, which considers the total number of received tokens and the sender's social position. To measure friendship, we run a peer nomination questionnaire, where students nominated up to five friends. Then, we investigate how dyadic cooperation varies according to social status and friendship. In general, we find that the more significant the difference in social status, the greater the dyadic cooperation gap, indicating acts of deference from lower-status individuals to higher-status individuals. However, when we separately analyze relationships involving mutual declarations of friendship, the association between social status and cooperation disappears. Among friends, we do not observe acts of deference from the lower status to the higher status member of the dyad. These results suggest that friendship implies fundamental equality, which is not affected by social status differences in elementary school students.
