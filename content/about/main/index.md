intro: |
  My background is in applied microeconomics, particularly impact evaluation with econometrics tools. I have a Masters in Economics @ Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC) and previously studied Commercial Engeneering @ Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (PUCV), that is similar to double major Economics and in Business administration.
  I used to taught Introductory Economics, microeconomics and Game Theory at PUCV between 2013 and 2019 before my Phd, and have taught courses in the Data Science department at Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD).
  I also enjoy drawing, reading fantasy and comics.
