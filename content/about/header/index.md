<!-- this is a subheadline -->

My name is Melanie Oyarzun, I'm from Chile and currently studyng Phd in Social Complexity Sciences \@ Universidad del Desarollo in the [Center for Social Complexity Sciences](https://complejidadsocial.udd.cl) (CICS in spanish).

Currently, I'm studyng social interaction patterns in students' educational experience with a computational social sciences approach. My supervisor is [Cristian Candia](https://linktr.ee/crcandiav).

We combine experimental game theory, network analysis and quantitative data analysis methods to study social interaction, cooperation and reciprocity in classroom environments.

Currently I'm working in 3 different studies:

**1. Reciprocity heightens academic performance in elementary school students**

( [Cristian Candia](https://linktr.ee/crcandiav), **Melanie Oyarzun**, [Victor Landaeta](https://dccs.udd.cl/persona/victor-landaeta-torres/), [Tamara Yaikin](https://dccs.udd.cl/persona/claudia-fernandino-bonino-2/), [Cecilia Monge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceciliamonge), [César Hidalgo](https://cesarhidalgo.com) and [Carlos Rodríguez-Sickert](https://dccs.udd.cl/persona/carlos-rodriguez-sickert-2/) )

-   We analyze how social relations within the classroom influence learning outcomes. Is reciprocity in social relationships is beneficial for learning in elementary school students? We provide evidence that is important.

(under revision, check preliminary version at [SocArXiv](10.31235/osf.io/nzvms))

**2. Social interactions and reciprocity in public elementary schools' neurodiverse classrooms**, part of the [Stars Project](https://moyarzun.netlify.app/stars/)

( [Patricia Soto-Icaza](https://dccs.udd.cl/persona/patricia-soto-icaza/), **Melanie Oyarzun**, [Tamara Yaikin](https://dccs.udd.cl/persona/claudia-fernandino-bonino-2/), [Mirla Arcos](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mirla-Arcos-Polanco), [Cristian Candia](https://linktr.ee/crcandiav), [Carlos Rodríguez-Sickert](https://dccs.udd.cl/persona/carlos-rodriguez-sickert-2/) , and [Pablo Billeke](https://dccs.udd.cl/persona/pablo-billeke-2/) )

-   We study the role of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly Autism and ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders) in social relationships in schools with national integration program (PIE in spanish).
- We are completing the data analysis and starting the writting process.

**3. Friendship Modulates Hierarchical Relations in Public Elementary Schools**
( **Melanie Oyarzun**,  Cristian Candia and Carlos Rodriguez-Sickert)

-   We design and validate a behavioral measure for social status for elementary school students. Then, we explore the connection between friendship and dyadic cooperation in students of different social ranks.
- Currently writing the manuscript, you can see a poster presentation here: <https://osf.io/whabz/>
