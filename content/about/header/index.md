<!-- this is a subheadline -->

My name is Melanie Oyarzun, I'm from Chile and currently studyng Phd in Social Complexity Sciences \@ Universidad del Desarollo in the [Center for Social Complexity Sciences](https://complejidadsocial.udd.cl) (CICS in spanish). Here I study social interaction patterns in students' educational experience with a computational social sciences approach. My supervisor is [Cristian Candia](https://linktr.ee/crcandiav). We combine experimental game theory, network analysis and data analytical methods to study social interaction, cooperation and reciprocity

## Research Projects

Currently **I'm working in 3 different studies**:

**1.**  Reciprocity heightens academic performance in elementary school students (under revision, check the SocArXiv:<https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nzvms/> )

  - Analyze how social relations within the classroom influence learning outcomes. Is reciprocity in social relationships is beneficial for learning in elementary school students? We provide evidence that is important.

**2.**  Social interactions and reciprocity in public elementary schools' neurodiverse classrooms, part of the [**Stars Project**](https://moyarzun.netlify.app/stars/)

  - Study the role of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly Autism and ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders) in social relationships in schools with national integration program (PIE in spanish).

**3.**  Friendship Modulates Hierarchical Relations in Public Elementary Schools (writting, you can see a poster presentation here: https://osf.io/whabz/ )

  - We design and validate a behavioral measure for social status for elementary school students. Then, we explore the connection between friendship and dyadic cooperation in students of different social ranks.

## About me: 

My background is in applied microeconomics, particularly impact evaluation with econometrics tools. I have a Masters in Economics \@ Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC) and previously studied Commercial Engeneering \@ Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (PUCV), that is similar to double major Economics and in Business administration.

I teached Introductory Economics, microeconomics and Game Theory at PUCV between 2013 and 2019 before my Phd, and have teached courses in the Data Science department at Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD).

I also enjoy drawing, reading fantasy and comics and you can get in touch in twitter \@mel2kill
