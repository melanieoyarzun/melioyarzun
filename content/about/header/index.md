<!-- this is a subheadline -->

My name is Melanie Oyarzun, I'm from Chile and currently studyng Phd in Social Complexity Sciences \@ Universidad del Desarollo in the [Center for Social Complexity Sciences](https://complejidadsocial.udd.cl) (CICS in spanish). 

Currently, I'm studyng social interaction patterns in students' educational experience with a computational social sciences approach. My supervisor is [Cristian Candia](https://linktr.ee/crcandiav). 

We combine experimental game theory, network analysis and quantitative data analysis methods to study social interaction, cooperation and reciprocity in classroom environments.

# Resarch projects

Currently I’m working in 3 different studies:

**1. Reciprocity heightens academic performance in elementary school students** (under revision, check working paper version at SocArXiv: 10.31235/osf.io/nzvms)
* We analyze how social relations within the classroom influence learning outcomes. Is reciprocity in social relationships is beneficial for learning in elementary school students? We provide evidence that is important.

**2. Social interactions and reciprocity in public elementary schools’ neurodiverse classrooms**, part of the [Stars Project](https://moyarzun.netlify.app/stars/)
* We study the role of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly Autism and ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders) in social relationships in schools with national integration program (PIE in spanish).

**3. Friendship Modulates Hierarchical Relations in Public Elementary Schools** (currently writing the manuscript, you can see a poster presentation here: https://osf.io/whabz/ )
* We design and validate a behavioral measure for social status for elementary school students. Then, we explore the connection between friendship and dyadic cooperation in students of different social ranks.
