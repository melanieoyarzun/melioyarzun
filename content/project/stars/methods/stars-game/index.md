## Experimental Game Theory applied in the classroom

-   In our **experimental design** we implemented game theory to collect behavioral data that capture social interaction in an ecologically valid context.

-   We designed a computational interface in which participants played a **non anonymous dictator game adapted for young children with and without special educational needs.**

  - Instructions and interface is written and with audio instructions, allowing students that do not know how to read to play.
  - Students with special needs were accompanied by an special need specialist or teacher during the game, if needed.
  -  The game duration is between 5 and 10 minutes.
