## Experimental Game Theory

-   In our **experimental design** we implemented game theory to collect behavioral data that capture social interaction in an ecologically valid context.

-   We designed a computational **non anonymous dictator game adapted for young children with and without special educational needs.**

# Social Network Analysis

We constructed **two interaction networks** **for each classroom** in which students are nodes, and links are defined by their behavior in the game.

**Selection Network:**

-   Selection from participant A to B is a directed link.
-  We observe all choices for all players.	
-Centrality is total of received selections.

**Stars allocation Network:**

- Is a subset conditional on selection.
- Stars sent are weighted directed links.
- Centrality is sum of received.
