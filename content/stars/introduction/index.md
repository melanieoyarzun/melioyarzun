## Introduction:

Knowing how to live with others who are different from us is crucial for satisfactory social relationships. 

During childhood, schools are a critical environment where all kinds of social interactions occur.

Evidence has described children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD) displayed difficulties in peer functioning. 

Nevertheless, how different developmental conditions of children in a neurodiverse classroom are related to social dynamics and school coexistence are still unclear. 

## Hypotheses

1.Children with autism and ADHD have lower centrality in their peer social network compared to typically developing (TD) children and children with other special educational needs (SEN).
2. Children with autism and ADHD engage in less reciprocal relationships compared with TD children.

## What is a **Neurodiverse classroom**?

In the Chilean Educational System, students are assigned to an specific group of peers, which continues to be their classroom until they graduate. 

**Neurodiverse classrooms** are group of peers in which children with special educational needs (SEN) **engage and participate together** with other students in their formative activities.
